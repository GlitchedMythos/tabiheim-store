## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This application requires Supabase environment variables to be configured.

**⚠️ Important**: You must create a `.env` file before running the app.

### Installation

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. **Create `.env` file** with Supabase configuration:

```bash
# Create .env file in apps/web directory
touch .env
```

Add the following content to `.env`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0
```

📖 **See [ENV_SETUP.md](./ENV_SETUP.md) for detailed environment setup instructions.**

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

> **Note**: Make sure the Supabase local instance is running in the `api-worker` directory before starting the web app.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
